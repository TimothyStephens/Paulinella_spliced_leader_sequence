# *Paulinella* spliced leader sequence analysis

Scripts for the analysis of the *Paulinella* spliced leader sequence using RNA-seq data, with a focuse on the KR01 isolate.

## analysis directories
### features_upstream_of_SLaddition_sites/
Analysis of functional domains upstream or overlapping with SL addition sites

### search_SL_in_Povalis/
Search for SL RNA genes in *P. ovalis* the heterotrophic sister lineage to KR01.

### SL_from_mapped_reads_AllCDS/
Analysis of SL addition sites in KR01 using RNA-seq reads mapped to published CDS. 
These sites are filtered based on multiple criteria, using custom python and bash scripts (see run.sh files in each directory for more info). 

### SL_in_Paulinella_chromatophora_CCAC0185/
Analysis of SL addition sites in *P. chromatophora* using RNA-seq reads mapped to the published CDS.
